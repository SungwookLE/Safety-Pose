# Real-time 2D Multi-Person Pose Estimation on CPU: Lightweight OpenPose

This repository contains training code for the paper [Real-time 2D Multi-Person Pose Estimation on CPU: Lightweight OpenPose](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12004.pdf). This work heavily optimizes the [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) approach to reach real-time inference on CPU with negliable accuracy drop. It detects a skeleton (which consists of keypoints and connections between them) to identify human poses for every person inside the image. The pose may contain up to 18 keypoints: ears, eyes, nose, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. On COCO 2017 Keypoint Detection validation set this code achives 40% AP for the single scale inference (no flip or any post-processing done). The result can be reproduced using this repository. *This repo significantly overlaps with https://github.com/opencv/openvino_training_extensions, however contains just the necessary code for human pose estimation.*

### Other Implementations

* OpenVINO by [Pavel Druzhkov](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/pull/1718/).

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 16.04
* Python 3.6
* PyTorch 0.4.1 (should also work with 1.0, but not tested)

## Prerequisites

1. Download COCO 2017 dataset: [http://cocodataset.org/#download](http://cocodataset.org/#download) (train, val, annotations) and unpack it to `<COCO_HOME>` folder.
2. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Training

Training consists of 3 steps (given AP values for full validation dataset):
* Training from MobileNet weights. Expected AP after this step is ~38%.
* Training from weights, obtained from previous step. Expected AP after this step is ~39%.
* Training from weights, obtained from previous step and increased number of refinement stages to 3 in network. Expected AP after this step is ~40% (for the network with 1 refinement stage, two next are discarded).

1. Download pre-trained MobileNet v1 weights `mobilenet_sgd_68.848.pth.tar` from: [https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-mobilenet](https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-mobilenet) (sgd option). If this doesn't work, download from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Ya27IAhILvBHqV_tDp0QjDFvsNNy-hv/view?usp=sharing).

2. Convert train annotations in internal format. Run `python scripts/prepare_train_labels.py --labels <COCO_HOME>/annotations/person_keypoints_train2017.json`. It will produce `prepared_train_annotation.pkl` with converted in internal format annotations.

   [OPTIONAL] For fast validation it is recommended to make *subset* of validation dataset. Run `python scripts/make_val_subset.py --labels <COCO_HOME>/annotations/person_keypoints_val2017.json`. It will produce `val_subset.json` with annotations just for 250 random images (out of 5000).

3. To train from MobileNet weights, run `python train.py --train-images-folder <COCO_HOME>/train2017/ --prepared-train-labels prepared_train_annotation.pkl --val-labels val_subset.json --val-images-folder <COCO_HOME>/val2017/ --checkpoint-path <path_to>/mobilenet_sgd_68.848.pth.tar --from-mobilenet`

4. Next, to train from checkpoint from previous step, run `python train.py --train-images-folder <COCO_HOME>/train2017/ --prepared-train-labels prepared_train_annotation.pkl --val-labels val_subset.json --val-images-folder <COCO_HOME>/val2017/ --checkpoint-path <path_to>/checkpoint_iter_420000.pth --weights-only`

5. Finally, to train from checkpoint from previous step and 3 refinement stages in network, run `python train.py --train-images-folder <COCO_HOME>/train2017/ --prepared-train-labels prepared_train_annotation.pkl --val-labels val_subset.json --val-images-folder <COCO_HOME>/val2017/ --checkpoint-path <path_to>/checkpoint_iter_280000.pth --weights-only --num-refinement-stages 3`. We took checkpoint after 370000 iterations as the final one.

We did not perform the best checkpoint selection at any step, so similar result may be achieved after less number of iterations.

## Validation

1. Run `python val.py --labels <COCO_HOME>/annotations/person_keypoints_val2017.json --images-folder <COCO_HOME>/val2017 --checkpoint-path <CHECKPOINT>`

## Pre-trained model <a name="pre-trained-model"/>

The model expects normalized image (mean=[128, 128, 128], scale=[1/256, 1/256, 1/256]) in planar BGR format.
Pre-trained on COCO model is available at: https://download.01.org/opencv/openvino_training_extensions/models/human_pose_estimation/checkpoint_iter_370000.pth, it has 40% of AP on COCO validation set (38.6% of AP on the val *subset*).

## Python Demo <a name="python-demo"/>

We provide python demo just for the quick results preview. Please, consider c++ demo for the best performance. To run the python demo from a webcam:
* `python demo.py --checkpoint-path <path_to>/checkpoint_iter_370000.pth --video 0`
